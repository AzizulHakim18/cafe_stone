The pizzeria used a crust that was more appropriate to a pie (whence “pizza pie”) than a flatbread. Within that “pie shell,” a profusion of toppings were placed on a layer of mozzarella cheese, and the tomato sauce was layered on the top (not the bottom) of the toppings. The pizza pie was baked in a round cake pan coated with olive oil, which lent a crunchy quality to the crust."
